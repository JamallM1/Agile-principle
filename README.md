## Deliver Value Frequently

- I pride myself on bringing value especially coming from the Air Force where everyone brings something to the table and it sets you apart from being another number at a company and it's something that they will notice when you are abscent from the company. I lived in okinawa, JP for 2 years and the value that the locals brought a lot of value from the locals who worked at convience stores to the individuals who worked with the base general they both worked as hard and brought a lot of value.

# Agile-Value
## individuals and interactions over processes and tools.

- Individuals and interactions above procedures and tools, for example, since every software engineer has a unique manner of writing code and a varied level of productivity in their work. In contrast to all the other IDEs and technologies, I personally prefer utilizing VScode and github. Because we don't all employ the same procedures and resources, we are distinctive.
