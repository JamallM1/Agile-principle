## Deliver Value Frequently

- I pride myself on bringing value especially coming from the Air Force where everyone brings something to the table and it sets you apart from being another number at a company and it's something that they will notice when you are abscent from the company. I lived in okinawa, JP for 2 years and the value that the locals brought a lot of value from the locals who worked at convience stores to the individuals who worked with the base general they both worked as hard and brought a lot of value.
